"""
An ``agent`` bullet type: a coding agent in a Modal sandbox, with an optional MCP server.

A prompt bullet asks a model once. An agent bullet hands its rendered text — its
own words plus whatever flowed up from its children and `@` references — to
OpenCode as a task, in a fresh sandbox, and the agent works at it with its
tools (bash, file reads and edits, …) until it answers. That answer is the
bullet's output.

Any stdio MCP server can ride along. Everything lives in the one sandbox:
nothing is hosted and no ports are exposed.

    Modal sandbox       (main process: a plain ``sleep``)
    └── run_agent.py    writes OpenCode's config, checks the MCP server comes
                        up, runs ``opencode run`` headless and reads its events

OpenCode is an MCP client itself: it launches the server over stdio and holds
the one session for the whole run, which keeps the server's state alive across
steps, and hands the model its tools (and any images they return) directly.

The server to launch is a per-bullet setting — ``{{ config(model_type=
"agent_modal", mcp_server="uvx some-mcp-server") }}`` — so it travels in the
model source like a python bullet's packages do (see `modal_exec.config_line`).

The model's key does *not*: a key written into the source would end up in the
cache key and in every export. It is carried per run in a context variable set
by ``main.run`` (``use_run``), along with the run's step limit and where its
live log lines go,, which every task pbt spawns inherits, and
reaches the sandbox as a Modal secret built on the spot.

The bullet's output is a JSON object, not bare text:

    {"output": <the agent's answer>, "logs": [...], "run_time": <seconds>}

``logs`` is the run end to end, one line per event with its offset from the
start: the sandbox being created, the MCP server coming up and each tool call it
served, every agent step (its thought, its command, what the command returned),
how the agent finished, and the teardown. ``run_time`` is wall-clock seconds from
creating the sandbox to terminating it. When the bullet has JSON enforced,
``output`` is the answer parsed, and an answer that will not parse fails it.

A bullet set to produce files (``produces_files=True``) also has ``files``: the
agent is told to save them in ``/root/outputs/``, and each one it saved comes
back as a ``pbt.File`` — handed to the bullets downstream as attachments.
