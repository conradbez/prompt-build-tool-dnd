"""The agent inside an agent bullet's sandbox: OpenCode, run headless.

Usage: run_agent.py <task file> <result file> [MCP server command…]

The task arrives as a file rather than an argument because it is a rendered
bullet — upstream answers and all — and has no business being limited by argv.
It reaches OpenCode on stdin. The result is written as JSON to *result file*.

OpenCode speaks MCP itself: the server whose command follows the result file
is launched over stdio, held open for the whole run (so its state carries from
one call to the next), and its tools reach the model as `mcp_<tool>`, next to
OpenCode's own bash, read, edit and the rest. Images a tool returns are shown
to the model.

Model and key come from the environment (`AGENT_MODEL`, as OpenCode's
`provider/model`, and the provider's own key variable, which OpenCode reads) —
set by `agent_exec.py` per run.
